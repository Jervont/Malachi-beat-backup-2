   <p>At the beginning of the year, I was dreading the subject, web design.</p>
   <p>And I mean dreaded.</p>
   <p>Coding, continued to baffle me, even after ten years, when I first set my sights on my greatest foe, and it didn't help that everything the teacher spoke, was like hearing another language.</P>  
   <p> For weeks, I just couldn't wrap my head around it but it wasn't until I had actually sat down, by myself, wrote some notes did heaven itslef open up to me. </p>
   <p> At long last something was getting through my brain and after having somebody in my class that did Game design for 2 years, did I obtain the weapon, I needed to tackle the beast.</p>

<h3>Drawing habit</h3>
        <p> At the beginning of the year, I had little to no experience with drawing digital using a computer so I brought a sketchbook for any drawings, I might come with.</p>
        <p>This provesd to be a wised choice because I found myself doing life drawings and illustrations.</p>
        <p>I was encouraged to draw anything my mind could think of and here are some of the images, that I have produced since I started collage.</p>
        <p>Eventually a purchased a tablet and began to draw digitally and to my surprise, the feeling was as if I was drawing with a pencil and pen</p>
        <p>I've also noticed that the more I draw the more my drawing improves.</p>

	<h4>Editing</h4>
	<p> I am also focusing on my skills as a editor, there is always something new to learn and even after editing for six years, I am still amazed by the work put out by editors on the web like Lopmon </p>

	    <p>My goal is to become this good in the editing department. I've already seen a difference from my editing from six years ago, when I first started.</p>
	    <p> I now have AE and Adobe Photoshop, from now on my skill can evolved from there since I now have the main programs to produce something like this.</p>
	    <p>The picture below is proof of how much I've improved in setting up a scene.</p>
